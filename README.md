# ☁️ AWS Projects Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of **AWS automation projects and case studies** showcasing how to leverage Amazon Web Services for building scalable, secure, and efficient cloud solutions.  

The aim is to demonstrate how AWS empowers developers, cloud engineers, and DevOps professionals to:  
- Provision and manage infrastructure using **boto3** and AWS services  
- Automate deployments and workflows  
- Integrate serverless components, databases, and storage  
- Build event-driven and cost-efficient architectures  

Each task folder contains:  
- A **README.md** with project details, objectives, and implementation steps  
- A **blog-link.txt** pointing to a detailed LinkedIn post for in-depth explanation
