# ðŸ”— Connect Python to AWS MongoDB (DocumentDB) via Lambda

## Introduction
AWS DocumentDB is a fully managed MongoDB-compatible database.  
This project shows how to **connect Python applications to DocumentDB using AWS Lambda**.

By combining serverless compute with a managed database, you achieve scalable and cost-effective solutions.

## Objectives
- Deploy a Python function in AWS Lambda.
- Connect to DocumentDB securely.
- Perform basic CRUD operations.

## Steps
1. Create a DocumentDB cluster and configure networking.
2. Write a Python Lambda function to interact with the database.
3. Test the connection and run queries.
