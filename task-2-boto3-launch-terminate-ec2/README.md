# ðŸš€ Launch & Terminate EC2 Instances using boto3

## Introduction
Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.  
This project demonstrates how to **automate EC2 instance lifecycle** using Pythonâ€™s `boto3` SDK.

By writing scripts, you can launch, stop, and terminate instances programmatically â€” an essential skill for DevOps engineers.

## Objectives
- Use `boto3` to interact with AWS EC2.
- Automate instance creation and termination.
- Understand IAM permissions required for EC2 operations.

## Steps
1. Install and configure `boto3` with AWS credentials.
2. Write Python code to:
   - Launch a new EC2 instance.
   - Stop or terminate it as needed.
3. Test automation to ensure smooth lifecycle management.
